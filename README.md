Airline Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization on airline-related datasets using Power BI. 
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed information about
airline operations, performance, and other key metrics. The goal of this project is to provide insights into various 
aspects of airline performance, including delays, cancellations, on-time performance, and passenger satisfaction.
